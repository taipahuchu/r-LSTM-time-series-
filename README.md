# RNN-LSTM-TimeSeries_Forecasting
Time Series Forecasting using Recurrent Neural Network - LSTM model using Keras Library for deep learning.

Description: Time Series Forecasting using Recurrent Neural Network - LSTM model using Keras Library for deep learning.
The technique used is sliding window where a window is moved over prices every timestep to capture the trends. 
The concept is widely used in commodity and stock trading. 
Note: The code is currenlty suffering from overfitting problem and will be re-patched
